                Freddy is a brown animatronic bear with a lighter shade of brown on both his stomach and puffy muzzle.
                He wears a black top hat, black bow tie with a neck strap, and wields a microphone in his right hand.
                He has thick black eyebrows, three-toed feet, and three black freckles on both sides of his muzzle. On his palms and 
                underneath his fingers, he has what appears to be paw-like prints. His round ears are articulated and are thus able 
                to move backwards and forward. Freddy sports squarish, human-like teeth in his lower jaw, and has no visible teeth on 
                his upper jaw.

                Bonnie is an indigo-colored animatronic rabbit with blue accents, magenta eyes and a squarish muzzle. The color from 
                his muzzle, stomach, and insides of his ears is a lavender color (white in Help Wanted). While Bonnie appears purple in 
                artworks and in Special Delivery, he's shown to be more dark blue than purple in most of the games where he and his 
                counterparts appear, including FNaF World. This could indicate he was blue at one point, but got a paint job of purple 
                under unknown circumstance, hence the blue blotches. He sports long articulated ears that are capable of bending 
                backwards and forwards and wears a red bowtie with a neck strap that is 
                partially obstructed by his chin. Onstage, he carries a dark red guitar. Unlike the other characters, he has round teeth 
                and lacks eyebrows. Excluding his head, most of Bonnie's body appears identical to Freddy's, apart from the latter's 
                color. This version of Bonnie has no visible teeth on his upper jaw.

                Chica is a bright yellow animatronic chicken with a spherically-shaped head, orange beak, magenta eyes, and black 
                eyebrows. On the top of her head are three "tufts" of feathers. She has two talons from each of her orange feet. She 
                wears a white bib that reads "LET'S EAT!!!" in yellow bubble letters, outlined in purple, with the bib flecked with 
                tricolored triangles in patterns of three, and what appear to be tiny stylized pizza slices.

                <br><br>
                Foxy is a large, animatronic fox with crimson, tattered fur. He has yellow eyes, red eyebrows, and three strings of 
                hair from the top of his head. He has a hook for his right hand and his left hand has been worn down to the endoskeleton. 
                He also bears an eye patch that is folded over his right eye, although he is usually seen with it above his eye rather 
                than covering it. Unlike the stereotypical fox, Foxy doesn't have a tail. Foxy wears brown linen pants that are 
                especially shredded at the legs. He appears to be damaged, as parts of his machinery are exposed. It can be clearly 
                seen that both his legs, with the exception of his upper thighs, and his left hand is completely bare, exposing the 
                metal endoskeleton underneath. His chest is ripped in various places, showing the endoskeleton beneath, and his arms 
                and stomach are torn apart as well, with tufts of fur on the shoulders. He also seems to have a slightly droopy left 
                eyelid. Like all of the other Fazbear characters, Foxy has a set of teeth. Foxy's teeth, however, appear to be the 
                sharpest out of all the animatronics, being similar to those of an actual canine, while the other animatronics' teeth 
                resemble human-like dentures or herbivorous teeth. It's also notable that, in keeping with the pirate motif, he has 
                several golden teeth and also appears to have some teeth missing, though this may be due to him needing repairs. He 
                also has a hanging jaw; this is also likely due to him needing repairs. His ears are articulated, thus able to move 
                back and forth and left to right.

                <br><br>
                Golden Freddy appears to be a cross between Freddy Fazbear and Fredbear with missing eyes. He sports a black bowtie and 
                top hat similar to Freddy, and upon closer inspection a microphone can be seen lying on his right palm, as well as two 
                pinprick white dot-like pupils within his otherwise empty eye sockets. He sits in a slouched position as if he were 
                deceased, with his jaw hanging open and his paws facing palms up. Despite popular belief, he has an endoskeleton that 
                can be easily seen by looking at the arms. If one looks at the arms, a few wires and parts of the endoskeleton are 
                visible, which share the same coloration as his accessories, though this may just be cords holding together the separate 
                pieces of his suit.
