            My main point about this game is that, it's gameplay may at times seem very repetitive, and the community has overdone the 
            game a bit. But the story behind this and the other games are so superbly brilliant that I do not want anyone to miss out on 
            it. If you can get past the gameplay and see under the game to the storyline, I can bet you will find it just as good as I do!
            <br><br>
            If you don't want a little spoiler don't read this part
            <br><br>
            Okay when the story starts the feeling of helplessness grows so much and it eventually turned to anger against not the 
            animatronics, but the purple man (the killer). Scott has managed to hide the identity of this character, and not given 
            is many options to who he is, not to mention he is in every game except the first one cause it doesn't have mini games. If 
            you've seen the game you know what happens to him and that it is truly satisfying as you cause it to happen. Even after the 
            games 'conclusion' in FNAF3, there's still stuff to find and secrets to uncover. Overall a great game, and well worth the 
            money.

            When Scott Cawthon Made Some Christian Kids Games, Critics HATTED Them, Saying It The Characters Look Like Nightmares. 
            Then Mr. Cawthon Got an Idea, an Awful Idea, Mr. Cawthon Got a Wonderfully Awful Idea. Making Five Nights at Freddy's. 
            You Are Night Guard Working at Freddy Fazbear'd Pizzeria, But The Catch Is, The Animatronics Are Trying To Kill You. 
            Unlike a Lot of Games You Stay In The Same Place, Your Office. The Gameplay Is Really Well Planed, It's Flawless. The 
            Phone Calls Are Chilling, The Jumpscares Are, Well, Scary. Th A.I Is Great, And There's Near-To-No-Music, Making Every 
            Crack And Thump Making You Jump & Paranoid, And There's So Many Creepy Secrets (Like Golden Freddy). And After The 5 Nights 
            There's a Few Bonus Content: Night 6, A Harder Night, After That, Custom Night (Night 7), Where You Can Control The 
            Animatronics. A True Masterpiece of Horror,

            A nice and very unique horror experience, before some minutes, it turns quite boring by rockstarproductions

            Five Nights at Freddy's (2014) Plot: 8.3/10 Gameplay: 7.2/10 Design: 7.8/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Sound Effects and OST: 7.7/10 
            Graphics: 5.7/10 Scary Factor: 7.3/10 Content: 3.9/10
            <br><br>
            FINAL SCORE: 7.2/10 (7 stars out of 10) The classic one! The one who started it all, for sure, The king of nostalgia, bringing 
            us back to 2014! The atmosphere is great, remembering to us, how scary the first game was, good lore start and effective 
            scares, but I feel FNAF 1 pretty overrated, because it fails with it's minimum content and non-challenging gameplay (except 
            for 20/20/20/20 mode)

            It use to be fun at the time and now every since the fanbase was born, it got destroy by fan art and stupid stuff like 
            that. And most people praise the game because of the storyline? What storyline? It's an indie game not a full pledge game. 
            The fanbase is terrible like the Rick and Morty fanbase like they will attack you because of your opinion on this game! 
            I'm not scared of them because they're little kids like 98% of them are. This is a terrible and very un scary game also 
            quit it with the jumpscare already it's old now. Cringy fanbase, enough said! 1.5/10

            Massively overrated. The backstory is okay, but it's not explored at all in-game. You're just sitting on your butt waiting 
            to be jumpscared; there's no depth at all.
